# Simpsons Trivia Game

This game was designed with the intent to show off my ability to engineer a themed trivia game that displays a clean UI (User Interface). I chose to incorporate a Simpsons theme background for this project that enables the user to answer pre-determined Simpsons trivia questions. For each question, the user has 30 seconds to answer each question otherwise it will mark the answer as wrong automatically. At the end of the 10 series questions, the page displays the number of correct and incorrect answers the user submitted. 

## How to Access

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this game was to showcase the ability to engineer an application in which the use timers was essential. As you will notice while playing the game, a timer was set for each question.
